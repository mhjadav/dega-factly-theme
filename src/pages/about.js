              In 2005, India legislated one of the best ‘Right to Information’
              laws in the world which changed the public information landscape
              and accessibility in the country. It was the first step towards
              transparency and accountability of governance. In 2012, India came
              up with the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy
              (NDSAP), popularly known as the ‘Open Data policy’ of the
              Government of India. In Spite of these systems in place, data and
              information remain in complex and overwhelming formats in the
              country. Some of the data that is meant for the public does not
              even exist in the public domain. Factly was born to create
              supporting platforms and infrastructure to bridge this gap and
              strengthen democracy through engagement.

                  Factly believes that for better public engagement with
                  government data, the supply side also has to be strengthened.
                  Factly actively advocates ‘Open Data’ policy to governments
                  and agencies that house large amounts of public information.
                  Factly collaborates and provides services to governments and
                  institutions to release data to the public domain. Besides
                  these, Factly engages with various stakeholders from across
                  the ‘Open Data’ spectrum to build successful case studies &
                  use cases. Factly also conducts training sessions on
                  accessing, understanding & analysing public data to
                  journalists, public policy enthusiasts, NGOs etc.
